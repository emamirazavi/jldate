# jldate

## About
This project named jldate created by S.Mohammad Emami Razavi
In fact i wanted to create an emulator for JS Date class
to modify all calendars to support jalali dates very quick.
It uses the `BSD 3-Clause License`
Good luck and under God.

BUG or issue:
UTC methods of date class of JS have rewritten with fake.
you can help me to implement it correctly !!! :)

### TESTED previously with:
1. bootstrap datetime picker
2. jQuery datetime picker
3. fullcalendar

### Now TESTED with:
1. fullcalendar @see fullcalendar* folder
2. somewhat moment

### HOW IT WORKS:
It's enough you replace jlDate with Date classname of JS
but you must escape from UTC methods, it's not implemented in jlDate for now
@see fullcalendar and moment sample

### Tested with
* [Fullcalendar](https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar)
* [Moment](https://github.com/moment/moment)
* [jQuery datetimepicker](http://plugins.jquery.com/datetimepicker/)
* [Bootstrap datetimepicker](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker)
